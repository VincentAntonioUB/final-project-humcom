        In my younger days, I often found myself in the role of a subject for my cousin, who had a passion for photography. I was a spirited child, relishing in the simple joys of life and readily engaging in playful activities wherever I found myself. Looking back, my early years are fondly remembered, as my family and I shared a home with four other families, creating a bustling and vibrant environment filled with noise and activity. Despite the chaos, this dynamic living arrangement added an element of excitement and interest to my formative years.

      This is me from middle school. Like in my early years in middle school, I was still a happy-go-lucky kid, but this time I know my limits. I matured a bit because, in middle school, all of my friends were somehow older than me, so I matured a bit early. My friends from when I was still in middle school are now in high school. The first two pictures are of me on a family vacation; back then, we used to have family vacations every year. The first photo was taken when I was in La Presa, Baguio City. I remember being sad because the road that we had to walk was muddy and my shoes were white, so when we were in the car, all I did was wipe my white shoes because they became brown because of the mud. The man at the back is my cousin, I learned a lot from him, especially my hobbies which is playing video games and drawing. In the second picture, when we were in the province, the one next to me was my cousin. That picture was taken after we went around and played in the kubo, which was like a ten-minute walk from the house, and of course, after we played and went back to the house, there was a lot of food waiting for us. In the third picture, it was also my cousin, whom I mentioned in my introduction. He was the one who liked to take pictures of me.

      This is now the present me. I'm still a happy-go-lucky person, but now I know my boundaries. I still act like a child, but I know when to act mature, depending on the situation. I met a lot of good people throughout my life, and I learned a lot from them. I adapted some of their hobbies, personalities, and such. I know that my kid me is happy because this is what he wanted to be back then. Kid me likes to have fun every time and have many good friends and play video games whenever he wants (not whenever because there are a lot of things that I have to do, but whenever I can). I think the present me is ready for the future. I’m kind of confident because I faced a lot of challenges in my early years and passed them all. It’s not easy because some of them almost made me give up, but here’s me writing this story of mine in this website while smiling because I reminisced about my early years.
